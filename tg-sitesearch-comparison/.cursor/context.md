# Trail-Gear Site Search Comparison

## Goal
Build a single static HTML page (Tailwind via CDN) that visually compares **Staging** vs **Production** site search results side-by-side. Highlight items that exist in Production but not in Staging for the same query with a subtle **“Prod only”** badge. No ranking judgments or scoring.

## Data
Two CSVs generated by `run_search_compare.py`:
- `stage_snapshot_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.csv`
- `prod_snapshot_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.csv`

**Schema:** `query, rank, sku, name, total_count`

Each query appears multiple times (one row per result). SKUs uniquely identify products.  

## Behavior
- One horizontal section per query.
- Two columns: **Staging (left)** and **Production (right)**.
- Items sorted by ascending rank.
- Add “Prod only” badge for Production SKUs not found in Staging for that query.
- Section header shows counts: `Staging: X • Production: Y`.
- Responsive, dark gray Tailwind theme, clean and minimal.

## Implementation
- Single `index.html`, no build tools.
- Load CSVs dynamically using **PapaParse (CDN)**.
- Read timestamp param `?ts=YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` → loads:
  - `stage_snapshot_${ts}.csv`
  - `prod_snapshot_${ts}.csv`
- If no `ts` provided, use fallback filenames in script.
- Parse, group by query, render side-by-side sections with badges.

## Cursor Prompt Context
You are working inside a static site repo.  
Use the above behavior and data rules to modify or extend `index.html` so it fetches and parses the CSV snapshots via PapaParse and renders the comparison dynamically with Tailwind styling.
